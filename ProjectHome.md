Using this class a programmer will be able to communicate with a library's integrated library system (ILS) via 3M's SIP2 (Standard Interchange Protocol).

This project is a work in progress, and as such there may be certain features that do not work correctly.  You can find the current stable version under the source tab, or download the current stable code [here](http://code.google.com/p/php-sip2/source/browse/tags/current/).

You may find it helpful to view the 3M documentation referenced in the Links section on the right.
